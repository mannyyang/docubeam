```

### Updating Structured Data

```html
<!-- Structured Data - Website -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
  {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "WebSite",
    "url": "https://docubeam.websyte.ai/",
    "name": "Docubeam",
    "description": "AI-powered PDF document management with OCR, file explorer, and intelligent chat capabilities."

    "url": "https://docubeam.websyte.ai/",
    "description": "Upload PDFs, extract text with OCR, browse documents with file explorer, and chat with AI about your document content.",
    "applicationCategory": "DocumentManagementApplication",

      "AI-Powered Document Chat",
      "Document Organization",
      "Cloud Storage Integration"
    ]
  }
</script>
```

### File Explorer SEO Considerations

The file explorer feature (`/files`) should be optimized for:

1. **Page Title**: "File Explorer - Browse Your Documents | Docubeam"
2. **Meta Description**: "Browse and manage your uploaded PDF documents with our intuitive file explorer. View document structure, download files, and preview content."
3. **Keywords**: "file explorer, document browser, PDF manager, file organization"

### Document Management SEO Keywords

Target keywords for the application:
- Primary: "PDF document management", "AI document chat", "OCR PDF extraction"
- Secondary: "file explorer", "document browser", "PDF organization"
- Long-tail: "upload PDF and chat with AI", "browse PDF documents online", "extract text from PDF with OCR"

### Updating the OG Image

The Open Graph image is used for social media sharing. To update it:

1. Create a new image file (1200x630 pixels recommended) and place it in the `public` folder
2. Update the `og:image` and `twitter:image` meta tags in `index.html`
3. Consider creating feature-specific images for file explorer and chat functionality

### Updating the Sitemap

The sitemap.xml file helps search engines discover and index your pages. To update it:

1. Open `public/sitemap.xml`
2. Add entries for new pages:
   ```xml
   <url>
     <loc>https://docubeam.websyte.ai/files</loc>
     <lastmod>2025-05-31</lastmod>
     <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
     <priority>0.8</priority>
   </url>
   ```
3. Update the `<lastmod>` dates when content changes

### Updating Robots.txt

The robots.txt file provides instructions to search engine crawlers. To update it:

1. Open `public/robots.txt`
2. Ensure file explorer and document pages are crawlable:
   ```
   User-agent: *
   Allow: /
   Allow: /files
   Disallow: /api/
   
   Sitemap: https://docubeam.websyte.ai/sitemap.xml
   ```

## Page-Specific SEO Implementation

6. Use canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content issues
7. Test your SEO implementation using tools like Google's Structured Data Testing Tool and Facebook's Sharing Debugger
8. Optimize for feature-specific keywords (file explorer, document management, OCR)
9. Include alt text for images and icons in the file explorer interface
10. Ensure proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3) on all pages
